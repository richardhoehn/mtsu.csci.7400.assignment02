# MTSU CSCI 7400 - Assignment 02

Welcome to the MTSU CSCI 7400 - Assignment 02 demo.

The goal of this assignment is to learn about AWS cloud services. You should explore at least one AWS service and create a short video (10-15 minutes) about the selected service.

The video should give a brief description about the service â€“ what it is, why it is important, what are its use cases. The video should also include a small example use case using the selected AWS service. It is expected that a PowerPoint presentation is used to explain the contents of the video.

## ENV Setup

I did not publish the `.env` located in the root of hte `/src/` folder. The following should be the structure of the `.env` files:

```
AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
AWS_BUCKET=
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=
```
